# Summary:

As a user, I can:

1. See a table of all transactions.
2. Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This adds the new transaction to the table and the transaction is persisted.
3. Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term are shown in the transactions table.
4. Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table
